Project summary
    My intention was to create an application that I could use to learn Japanese Hiragana with (and eventually Katakana and Kanji if I continue to build it out), but my code goes through the english side of the flash cards only. Ideally this would have been randomized so that I wouldn't just have to memorize the next card anyway. I will try to work on this until the very very end, but it's currently 10:35pm and I am not hopeful. I tried for so long to get it to format decently, but I couln't figure out the CSS, and I also had an expecially difficult time linking/referencing all the files to each other. 
Key features and functionality
    I don't care if the cards show the hiragana side or the english side first as long as it shows the other version when the card is flipped.
    More hiragana (I only did 15 characters because I ran out of time) can be added and the maxIndex would adjust to additions.
Technologies used
    useState
Instructions for use
    Look at the card, click Next Card, and then weep because you're not learning anything from broken code.
